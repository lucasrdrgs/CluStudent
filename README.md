# CluStudent
Student clustering based on ENEM grades and socioeconomic factors.
Also has school efficiency estimator using an ensemble of regression models.

## Steps Taken
### 1. Gather data
We used data from ENEM 2019 acquired from [INEP](https://inep.gov.br). The data, however, has been taken down and replaced by ENEM 2020 (which we did not intend to use due to Covid influence on education, which we consider as an outlier). Therefore, we have decided to release the CSV we used [in this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xoeH5objOs0JGlGR4Xv59UwmGD0lsop2?usp=sharing).
